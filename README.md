# hyperdeck-mini-prometheus-exporter

A very hastily-written Prometheus exporter for the Blackmagic HyperDeck Studio Mini that grabs some metrics I needed:
- Both SD card remaining recording times
- Current status of the unit
- Current active SD card slot

If you came here looking for an impressive exporter, I apologize in advance. The Mini model does not have a Rest API and therefore options are limited.
